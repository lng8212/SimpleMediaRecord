## üìú Notes

- **Audio focus** is carefully managed to ensure good user experience across interruptions.
    
- **Device switching** is smooth on Android 12+, partially limited on Android <12.
    
- The app aims to give maximum control over recording/playback while handling different Android versions gracefully.
